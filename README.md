# Shopee-Code-League-2020
This consists of 2 projects that me and my team attempted. All images and datasets belong to Shopee Code League 2020 with full credits.
## 1. Product Detection

For product detection, we were given a problems consisiting of 100k images. The goal was to create a robust detection system that will improve the listing and categorisation efficiency. My team developed used computer vision to engineer an image classification model via "tensorflow" to determine the correct product categorisations.
